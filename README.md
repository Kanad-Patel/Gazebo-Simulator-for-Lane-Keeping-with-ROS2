# Gazebo-Simulator-for-Lane-Keeping-with-ROS2
## We are making a simulator and a platform of a lane-keeping car with ROS2 on Gazebo.

## How to run the Simulator?
For running the Simulator,you will need ROS2 Humble Hawksbill and Ubuntu 22.04 installed in your system. ** Note ** : It is good to use the native Ubuntu system rather than on a virtual machine.
